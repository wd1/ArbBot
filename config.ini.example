; The bot has a safety factor for being more conservative by default about
; transfering BTC versus other assets.  The bot tries to not lose more than
; 1% of an altcoin during transfer, but we are more conservative by a factor
; of btc-xfer-safety-factor.  For example if you adjust this value to 2,
; the bot tries to not lose more than 0.5% of our BTC during transfer, and
; help accumulate profits faster.

; This increases the chance to get the order filled, but could result in a loss.
; Note that if you set the buy factor too high and/or the sell factor too low,
; the bot may never end up entering a trade, with messages like "NOT ENTERING TRADE:
; REDUCED SELL RATE xxx IS BELOW INCREASED BUY RATE yyy", in which case you need
; to adjust these accordingly.  These numbers are factors that are multiplied into
