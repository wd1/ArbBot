# Arbitrator, A Bitcoin/Altcoin Arbitrage Trading Bot
The bot checks for altcoins, which are traded on both Poloniex and Bittrex and compares their prices. If the difference is big enough to earn at least some satoshis (after deducting transfer fees), it enters the trade. The bot records its activities and exchange rates in a database and uses this information to reinvest a portion of its profits into the most profitable (in terms of arbitragable) altcoin. Additionally, the amount of held altcoins is calculated based on their exchange rate, transfer fees and times. This allows the bot to profit from hyped (PnD) coins.

The original version of this bot had a [backdoor which was removed from this fork](https://github.com/cryptoeax/arbbot/commit/15abe54a462b9a6decb1ef2a197626b106c8e5d1) and the fork has gone through a security audit and to the extent of the knowledge of the current maintainer is free of any other security issues.  Furthermore, it currently has a few extra security features that prevent the web UI to be used in passwordless non-HTTPS Internet environments by default, which mitigates the original vulnerability that existed in the code.  The code base is kept small and simple for the purpose of making it possible for people to perform their own security audit should they choose so.  If you find any other bugs please file issues so that they can be fixed quickly!

You can see the bot running on a cheap [linode](https://www.linode.com) here.  Currently the bot is yielding daily profits of `7-20%` on a seed investment of around `0.4BTC`.

## Supported Exchanges

  * Bittrex (all BTC markets)
  * Bleutrade (all BTC markets)
  * Poloniex (all BTC markets)

## Installation on Debian 9.0+ / Ubuntu 16.04+

Install required packages:

```
sudo apt-get install git php-cli php-curl php-mysqlnd mysql-server nginx-full php-fpm unzip apache2-utils ntpdate
sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
```

Clone the repository on the server.  Note that installation from ZIP archives isn't supported any more.

```
cd /var/www
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cryptoeax/arbbot.git
```

cd into the directory:

```
cd arbbot
```

Prepare the MySQL database:

```
  mysql -u root -p
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE arbitrage;
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON arbitrage.* TO arbitrage@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
  mysql> use arbitrage;
  mysql> source database.sql;
  mysql> quit
  ```

Configure the database connection:

```
cp web/config.inc.php.example web/config.inc.php
nano web/config.inc.php
```


Configure the bot:

```
cp config.ini.example config.ini
nano config.ini
```

Edit all options to fit your needs and enter your API keys! You can change settings even while the bot is running. The changes will be automatically applied.

## Configuring the Webinterface

First, you need to configure a username and password:

```
htpasswd -b /var/www/conf/arbitrage.passwd username password
```

Then you need to edit the web server configuration.

```
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

The NGINX configuration file should look like this:

```
server {

        listen 80;
        root /var/www/arbbot/web;
        index index.html;
        server_name localhost;

        location / {

                auth_basic           "Restricted area";
                auth_basic_user_file /var/www/conf/arbitrage.passwd;

        }

        location ~ \.php$ {

          include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
          fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;

        }

}
```

If your web server is exposed to the public Internet, the UI will by default refuse to load unless you enable HTTPS.  You can get a free certificate using Let's Encrypt, see [this tutorial](https://www.nginx.com/blog/free-certificates-lets-encrypt-and-nginx/) on how to do that.  Assuming you have a certificate, you would need to add a `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` directive to the configration file, if the Let's Encrypt client doesn't do that for you (which it should.)  If you are going to access your bot on <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> then you don't need to perform this step.

Now, restart the webserver:

```
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

You should now be able to access the webinterface with your browser.

## Running the bot

Now you are ready to give the bot a test by running it:

```
php main.php
```

(Note: It is recommended to run `main.php` with [`hhvm`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/linux) instead of `php` in order to speed up the bot a bit.)

You should see output like this:

```
19:13:34: ARBITRATOR V2.0 launching

```
To actually allow the bot to buy coins automatically, you need to reserve some autobuy funds.  You can do that either by running the following commands against the database manually:
```
  mysql -u root -p
  mysql> use arbitrage;
  mysql> UPDATE stats SET value = "0.2" WHERE keyy = "autobuy_funds";
  mysql> quit
```

This example assigns 0.2 BTC to the "autobuy_funds". The higher the amount, the more coins can be bought and
the more arbitrage-opportunities can be taken. Be careful to keep at least 0.1 - 0.2 BTC at the exchange to give
the bot enough room to trade.

Alternatively by enabling the `general.admin-ui` setting, the web UI shows you the Admin interface which allows you to change the autobuy funds amount.  It is not recommended to enable this if your web UI isn't secure using password authentication and HTTPS in case it's exposed to the Internet.

## How does the bot make profit?

Arbitrage trading means that differences in exchange rates between two exchanges are used to gain a profit.
These opportunities usually exist only for a few seconds. It is important to act fast when such an opportunity
is detected.

If you would buy the altcoin as soon as a price difference is detected and send it to the other exchange to
sell it, you would most likely make a loss with this trade. Transfering coins usually takes 15 to 60 minutes.
Enough time for the exchange rates to equalize.

To make a profit from price differences you must deposit the altcoin at the exchange with the higher
sell rates (BID) and some BTC at the exchange with the higher buy rates (ASK).

Lets take BTCD as an example:

At Bittrex the current sell rate (BID) is 0.00395000 BTC
At Poloniex the current buy rate (ASK) is 0.00382098 BTC

This means a Spread of 0.00012902 BTC

The bot sells BTCD at Bittrex for 0.00395000 BTC each and instantly buys the same amount at Poloniex
for 0.00382098 BTC each. After the trade there is no change in the amount of BTCD. However, there is a
profit of 0.00012902 BTC per traded BTCD.

The BTCD are now being transfered from Poloniex to Bittrex and can then be used for trading.

It wouldn't be very easy to buy all those altcoins for the bot. Additionally, some of them have such low
volumes that there is rarely a trading opportunity. But you can delegate this job to the bot!

The bot will monitor the orderbooks of both exchanges and will decide which coins are worth to trade with.
You will notice some messages like `TRADE IS NOT PROFITABLE WITH AVAILABLE FUNDS` in the log. This means
that the bot has noted in its database that this coin can be traded with. During the next buying cycle, it
will consider buying this coin.
