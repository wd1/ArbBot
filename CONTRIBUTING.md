# Contributing to Arbitrator

Arbitrator right now is a very small project and as such doesn't have very extensive documentation helping new contributors to get started yet.

The best way right now is probably to hop on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cryptoeax-arbbot) and introduce yourself and tell me what you'd like to work on.  I will do my best to help, but I will probably not accept any and all modifications to the bot.  There are also a number of open issues that can be worked on at anny given time, please have a look at those as well.

If you have never contributed to a Github project before, see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on how to create a pull request.
