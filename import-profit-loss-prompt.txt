The bot has detected that you have just upgraded to a new version which
supports storing the profit&loss information in the database which enables
faster retrieval times.

We now need to do a one time conversion of your current data to store it
in the database, and from now on your new trade's data will be stored in
the database automatically.

Press enter when you are ready to start.  This operation may take a while.
